# Mean-Variance-SD-Calculator
I made a calculator that returns the mean, variance, standard deviation and other measures from a list of 9 numbers using **Numpy (Python)**.

This is the 1st of 5 projects to get the Data Analysis with Python certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

In this project, I used **Numpy**, lists, disctionaries and Python Exceptions.
